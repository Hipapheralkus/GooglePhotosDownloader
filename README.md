# Google Photos ‚Üí Pixel 1 Migration Scripts

This repository contains scripts to streamline migrating your largest files from Google Photos to a Pixel 1 device, leveraging the unlimited original-quality storage, while preserving original metadata.

---

## üì¶ Repository Contents

- **SeleniumScraper.py**
  - Navigates the Google Photos web UI via Selenium to download your largest photos and videos.
  - Logs each item's metadata (link, filename, date/time taken, GPS coordinates, location name, album list) into `google_photos_videos.csv` for later processing.

- **UpdateMetadata.py**
  - Reads `google_photos_videos.csv` and applies GPS and creation-time metadata to each video file using `ffmpeg`.
  - Moves processed files into a `ready_for_upload/` directory alongside `gp_downloads/` for easy transfer to your Pixel 1.

## üöÄ Why This Approach?

1. **Pixel 1 Unlimited Storage:**  Pixel 1 historically offers free original-quality backups‚Äîideal for bulky archives.
2. **Web UI Scraping via Selenium:**  The Google Photos web interface exposes large items at `/quotamanagement/large`- we automate it to handle paging, downloads, and metadata extraction reliably.
3. **Decoupled Download & Tagging:**  Separating download (Selenium) from metadata tagging (`ffmpeg`) avoids complex browser-based metadata hacks and ensures precise timestamp/GPS application.
4. **CSV as Single Source of Truth:**  Capturing metadata in a CSV makes the workflow repeatable, auditable, and future-proof for further automation (e.g., album re-linking).

## ‚öôÔ∏è Prerequisites

- **Python 3.x** with `selenium` installed:  `pip install selenium`
- **Chrome** and corresponding **ChromeDriver** binaries (must match version). Download both from:

  https://googlechromelabs.github.io/chrome-for-testing/

- **ffmpeg** installed and available on your `PATH` for metadata operations.
- A logged-in Google account in your main Chrome instance (so Selenium can reuse your session).

## üõ†Ô∏è Setup & Configuration

1. **Copy a large-item link:**
   - Visit https://photos.google.com/quotamanagement/large and copy the URL of the first item - e.g., `https://photos.google.com/quotamanagement/large/photo/{uniqueID}`.
   - Paste it into the `START_URL` constant in `SeleniumScraper.py`.

2. **Configure Chrome & Profile Paths:**
   - In `SeleniumScraper.py`, update:
     - `CHROME_BIN` ‚Üí path to your Chrome executable
     - `USER_DATA_DIR` & `PROFILE` ‚Üí to reuse your logged-in profile. You can find this by opening `chrome://version` and checking the `Profile Path`. The last segment is `PROFILE`, for example `	C:\Users\user\AppData\Local\Google\Chrome for Testing\User Data\Default` means the `USER_DATA_DIR = C:\Users\user\AppData\Local\Google\Chrome for Testing\User Data` and `PROFILE = Default`
     - `CHROMEDRIVER_EXEC` ‚Üí path to matching ChromeDriver binary

3. **Download Directory:**
   - By default, downloads go to `./gp_downloads/`; adjust `DOWNLOAD_DIR` if needed.

4. **CSV Log:**
   - The first run creates `google_photos_videos.csv` with headers. Subsequent runs append only new links.

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Usage Workflow

1. **Download & Log Metadata**
   ```bash
   python SeleniumScraper.py
   ```
   - Automates paging through `/quotamanagement/large`, downloads each file, and logs metadata.

2. **Tag & Prepare for Upload**
   ```bash
   python UpdateMetadata.py -c google_photos_videos.csv
   ```
   - Applies `creation_time` and `location` tags to each video via `ffmpeg`.
   - Moves tagged files into `ready_for_upload/` for side-loading onto your Pixel 1.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Drawbacks & Future Improvements

- **No Automatic Deletion:**  The scripts do **not** remove originals from Google Photos to avoid accidental data loss. Manual trashing is recommended once verified.
- **Album Re-linking Missing:**  While album names are logged, re-adding items to their original albums is not implemented.
- **Face-Detection Uploads Fail:**  Pixel‚Äôs face-based auto-upload won‚Äôt trigger on files side-loaded from Pixel 1; manual sorting or future scripts required.
- **Geocoding Placeholder:**  If GPS data is missing, a `geocode_location()` stub exists but needs real implementation or integration with a geocoding API.
- **Visibility of Processed Items:** Once the biggest videos are moved to Pixel¬†1, they no longer appear in Google Photos‚Äô ‚ÄúLarge photos & videos‚Äù section. Therefore, each run starts from the first link in that section (rather than resuming from the last processed one) to ensure newly large files are captured.
